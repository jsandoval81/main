        <div class="grey-large">The early days</div>
        <p>
            OK – some of my corporate colleagues keep telling me “You’re not old. Do you even know what a Commodore 64 is?”. But everyone started somewhere. I can’t believe I’m about to say this, but I actually have to give more than a miniscule shred of credit to the “career day” at my high school. I’m <em>not</em> one of those who was disassembling my dad’s work computer when I was 4. Nor was I in (or aware of) any computer clubs. So when the guy from a local tech company said “go out and buy an HTML book” I did just that – and the journey began.
             
            By the time I knew what I was doing, the Internet couldn’t have been hotter. Business owners were emptying their wallets in to the hands of the first web developer they could find. My friend and I saw the opportunity and started our own web design “firm” (by “firm” I mean we had a professional-looking site – I loved the 90’s). My friend did the graphics and I did the code and away we went. We even convinced our school to let us do several independent study classes to bolster our skills. By the time we graduated I had made enough the cover the first couple years of college.
        </p>

        <div class="grey-large">College years</div>
        <p>
            Luckily, I was in college when “the bubble burst”. I was still making a few extra bucks on the side doing a business-card web site here and there. But I also did some pay-it-forward sites for friends and peers I’d hoped would make it big and then “remember that one time….”
             
            Halfway through college I landed a paid internship at a local tech company. Not much web development, but a definite crash course in hardware, networking, telecommunications, and production support. For several years I wore many hats; everything from technical project manager and business analyst to data and software engineer. I had the opportunity to build relationships with the Engineers, DBAs, System Administrators, etc. and see how all of the moving pieces fit together. I was able to provide a lot of value on the application design and data engineering fronts. Data (relational or otherwise) just makes sense to me. I can pull it out, transform it, and deliver it in a method that users understand, be it a CRUD app or reporting.
        </p>

        <div class="grey-large">Corporate and beyond</div>
        <p>
            In corporate land I’ve found myself doing a lot of enterprise ETL and reporting over the years. On the data warehousing and middle tiers this has been a strong mix of Oracle and SAS, in addition to a gazillion other RDBMS platforms. You name it we’ve warehoused it: SQL Server, MySQL, Tandem, Informix, Vertica, and others. On the front end it’s mostly been SAS (again), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
             
            Outside of corporate I do my best to keep up with evolving web technology. Admittedly, I’ve never been a big fan of Java and ASP.NET web stacks. While I do appreciate the robustness of traditional OOP, I just plain have more fun in languages like JavaScript.
             
            So, how do I fill the gap between a strong data engineering background and the front-end web development that I’ve always enjoyed? (you may see where this is going). The emergence of JavaScript as a robust, mature, server-side language was really a blessing for me. I enjoy a lot of the server-side pursuits, but I also like how frameworks like NodeJS take care of the gruesome parts and open up my time to tackle the parts of the stack that I want.
             
            And back on the data side – how about those document based data stores?! Very cool stuff. I’m still carving out the new region in my brain to separate the conventions of document-based storage from the traditional RDBMS realm. While Oracle and friends aren’t going anywhere for a while, I have definitely enjoyed the no-overhead, open-schema environment of MongoDB in the last few personal projects I’ve done.

            And the journey continues…
